## sql-data-shifter adapter for ioBroker

The `sql-data-shifter` adapter for ioBroker allows you to read data from an SQL database, process it, and write it to
another table. The adapter supports various operations such as sum, difference, and average of the data. It can also
delete data after it has been processed. The adapter is controlled by a schedule and can be configured to run regularly.
